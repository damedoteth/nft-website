# The Encyclopedia of NFTs

Ever since Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) entered onto the cultural scene back in March of 2021, they have been plagued by confusion and misunderstanding. Particular types of NFTs such as the well-known (and well-critiqued) Bored Ape Yacht Club have unintentionally led many people to develop a narrow and distorted view of what is actually a very broad and interesting piece of technology. 

The uses cases and methods of implementing NFTs are endless, but the cultural understanding is currently stuck. Furthermore, if a person is curious enough to look beyond the surface level, they might be hard pressed to navigate what’s underneath. Because of this, we have created the Encyclopedia of NFTs — it is our hope that the following resource will help interested explorers begin to grasp what NFTs as a technology actually have to offer. 

Let’s dive right in!
