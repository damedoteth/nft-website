# Choosing Types

*Things to think about when choosing which types you want to use.*

Due to the abundance of NFT types and combinations of those types, it would be impossible to cover every potential scenario. That being said, below you will find a few key dynamics to keep in mind that relate to a variety of NFT types.

## Collection Supply Sizes

When deciding how many editions to issue or how many total NFTs to have in a collection (or whether there should be a supply cap at all), it’s important to consider your target market, existing audience, goals, and cultural expectations. Each of these things might lead you in one direction or another depending on what is most and least important. If your NFT project is for-profit and you have certain budgetary needs or constraints, be sure to document and understand how your revenue goals relate to the supply size.

Lastly, If you don’t have the luxury of being able to experiment and make preliminary work to get some experience before launching a significant project, it can be helpful to study existing projects or collections that are similar in nature.

## Off-chain vs On-chain

On-chain NFTs can be quite popular within certain niches and sub-cultures, but they likely account for only a small fraction of the entire market. They’re much more difficult to create, the production costs are higher, and there are big limitations. Within all of these constraints though there is a giant world of creativity… but it might not be for everyone. If you’re just getting started with NFTs, it might be better to tackle something a bit more manageable first. 

Off-chain NFTs are much more prevalent, and nearly all of the most widely known NFT projects fall on the off-chain side of the spectrum because the technical limitations prevent higher resolution artwork from being stored on-chain. If you’re approaching NFTs with a pre-existing concept in mind, it’s likely that off-chain is the way to go based purely on what is and isn’t possible.

## More types, more complexity

While looking through the long list of NFT types in Part 1, you may be excited by the number of possibilities out there. You might even be tempted to combine lots of them together at once. Before you do though, it’s important to note that the more features and types you add together, the greater your costs will be… both in terms of time and money. Additionally, the more parts an NFT project has, the more ways something could go wrong or differently there are. Be wary of “feature bloat”.
